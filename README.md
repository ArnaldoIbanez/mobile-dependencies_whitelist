### DESCRIPTION

This repository contains all the definitions for the information tracked in *melidata* platform. The catalog serves as a central repository to governate our data, know what are we tracking and how. Further decription on [wiki](https://sites.google.com/mercadolibre.com/melidata/tracking/melidata-catalog)

### DISCLAIMER

- Always remember to define how your tracking "should be" not "as it is". We want this catalog to represent "the tracking we want" and not "the one we have". The catalog helps us to keep governance on our data and making it more predictable and easy to exploit

- Before making PR. Try to follow other definition examples and make sure your data is not already tracked. 

### REQUIREMENT

```
export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_212.jdk/Contents/Home 
```

If your JAVA_HOME is set to JDK 9+, it might trigger incompatibility problems.

### CONTACT ðŸ“ž
<melidata_dev@mercadolibre.com>

We internally ðŸ”„  **ï¿½ rotate in the Melidata team to periodically take PRs at this catalog**. This rotation should give you an assignee of the PR in a bunch of hours. We try to guide conversation through the PR in order to have traceability and public visibility. We try not to be blocker but to asssit the teams in [commmon styles and best-practices](https://github.com/mercadolibre/fury_melidata-catalog-definitions/wiki/Tracking-Style-Guide) and also check cohesion with other parts of the site/product we already know. We value the context you can add to the PR as far as MELI is a big ecosystem of products.

In case of a hurry ( just in that case ) you can reach catalog owner of the week by checking [this rotation](https://nasdaq-meli.app.opsgenie.com/settings/schedule/detail/e9e18d88-3536-4572-9351-6ab680d4b1ed) and follow conversation on slack of private channels ( not recommended! )

Finally, it's not necessary to share your PR at #team-melidata or melidata_dev@ we honor our rotation and will assist you on your PR. However, we value your feedback!
