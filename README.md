This repository contains a all the definitions about the information thacked thougth *melidata* platform

## Testing the catalog

If you want to run the tests, you should execute **```make test```**


## Add a new track

When you add a new track the most important thing to do it's add a test that validate the track that we are adding. To do that we should add a new test casse for our new track to **definitions/tests/tests.groovy**

In the file we should add a new test case whith one or more tracks to test. When we run the tests each track will be checked to see if these are valid
``` groovy
  test("Search gallery with 50 items" ) {  // <-- Test case definition (name)
      "/search"(platform:"/mobile") {  // <-- Track definition, path and platform
          limit = "50"      // <-- Property to track
          offset = 10       // <-- Property to track
      }   
  }
```
