## Context
[//]: # (Explain the context of your tracks so we can help you better)  	


## Need for this
[//]: # (Explain why do you need to track this, or who is asking for it.)  	

## Paths  	
[//]: # (Describe the paths or properties you are adding)  	

| Path/Property | Description |	
|---------------|-------------|	
|  |  |	


## Screenshots  	
[//]: # (Screenshots showing the view or the flow to be tracked are much appreciated!)  	

## Self-validation  	
[//]: # (Does your track check the following?)  	

- [ ] I made my changes, not to improve my SLA but to improve my tracking 	
- [ ] I know (or at least believe) no one is tracking this  	
- [ ] I prefered the usage of _required:true_ (default) fields	
- [ ] I limit the specific [_values_](https://github.com/mercadolibre/melidata-catalog/wiki/New-Track#descriptions-and-values-tags) a field can have	
- [ ] I have put [_description_](https://github.com/mercadolibre/melidata-catalog/wiki/New-Track#descriptions-and-values-tags) to every field on the catalog	
- [ ] By reading the path I can tell what the track is about	
- [ ] I am tracking events only because I cannot track views  	
- [ ] On each track I specify only the relevant platforms   	
- [ ] Same actions have same paths. Remember that core actions like [bookmarking](https://github.com/mercadolibre/melidata-catalog/blob/master/definitions/src/main/resources/catalog/bookmarks.groovy), [questions](https://github.com/mercadolibre/melidata-catalog/blob/master/definitions/src/main/resources/catalog/questions.groovy) or [adding items to cart](https://github.com/mercadolibre/melidata-catalog/blob/master/definitions/src/main/resources/catalog/add_to_cart.groovy) are already standarized events at Melidata. 	

## Disclaimer	
Passing SLA validation is not a justification for building bad-tracking. Remember SLA is just and indicator of ungovernanble/unpredictable tracking. The final aim is having good quality tracking.
