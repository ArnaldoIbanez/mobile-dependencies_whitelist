[//]: # (Does your track check the following?)  

- [ ] I know (or at least believe) no one is tracking this  
- [ ] I am tracking events only because I cannot track views  
- [ ] On each track I specify only the relevant platforms   
- [ ] By reading the path I can tell what the track is about  
- [ ] Same actions have same paths
