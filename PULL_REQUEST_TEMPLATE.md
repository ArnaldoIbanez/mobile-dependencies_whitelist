[//]: # (Tracks catalog PR template, delete if else!)  

## Context  
[//]: # (Explain the context of your tracks so we can help you better)  

## Need for this  
[//]: # (Explain why do you need to track this, or who is asking for it.)  

## Paths  
[//]: # (Describe the paths or properties you are adding)  

| Path/Property | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
|  |  |


## Screenshots  
[//]: # (Screenshots showing the view or the flow to be tracked are much appreciated!)  

## Self-validation  
[//]: # (Does your track check the following?)  

- [ ] I know (or at least believe) no one is tracking this  
- [ ] I limit the specific _values_ a field can have
- [ ] I prefered the usage of _required:true_ (default) fields
- [ ] I have put _description_ to every field on the catalog
- [ ] By reading the path I can tell what the track is about
- [ ] I am tracking events only because I cannot track views  
- [ ] On each track I specify only the relevant platforms   
- [ ] Same actions have same paths. Remember that core actions like [bookmarking](https://github.com/mercadolibre/melidata-catalog/blob/master/definitions/src/main/resources/catalog/bookmarks.groovy), [questions](https://github.com/mercadolibre/melidata-catalog/blob/master/definitions/src/main/resources/catalog/questions.groovy) or [adding items to cart](https://github.com/mercadolibre/melidata-catalog/blob/master/definitions/src/main/resources/catalog/add_to_cart.groovy) are already standarized events at Melidata.
